# Scenario 1: 20% of all gates become inoperable (randomly assigned)


# Scenario 2: The walking distances of the remote gates get multiplied by a factor 4


# Scenario 3: The safety interval increases to twice its current value (from 15 min to 30 min)


# Scenario 4: All small flights are delayed by one (1) hour


# Scenario 5: All large flights have twice the current amount of passengers (ratio dep. passengers and transfer passengers remains constant)


# Scenario 6: Flights from airline 2 have twice the current amount of passengers (ratio dep. passengers and transfer passengers remains constant)
